Patterns
--------

Repo for storing all the patterns that I often use, new patterns that I discover and
learned, revisiting patterns as well as additional code coolness that I find.

All examples are based on various resources found online to use as example,
annotated and sometimes extended with variations. All credits can be found in the
source header.

Feel free to contribute, critique, comment, add to it, etc. If we have enough
patterns, we can start a site that stores these examples.

Keep learning!
