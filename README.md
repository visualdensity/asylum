Code Chest
----------

This is a repository of various stuff that I have learned over time and contains
various code snippets from concrete, albeit simple implementations of various design
patterns, different types of algorithms and cool little code features in PHP.

Feel free to contribute, critique, comment, add to it, etc. If we have enough
material, I may start a site that shares this with the rest.

All examples should run without errors. Just navigate to `src/` folders and execute
the PHP files:

    php patterns/ChainOfCommand.php
    php algorithms/sort_bubble.v4.php
    ...

Keep learning!
